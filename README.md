## Git workflow
In the following subsections, the process of working with Git is described. (Contact @boomzilla if you have writing/stylistic suggestions.) (I am aiming for an audience fairly new to Git/Github, so if I my writing is unclear/overly complicated, please tell me. Although the converse isn't as much of a concern, feel free to mention it if I am needlessly belaboring a point.)

### fork from the "trunk" to your own Github profile
Log into your Github profile. Visit the [trunk](https://github.com/roseaboveit/FiftyTwoFriends), and click "Fork" (button at top-right of page).

### clone to your local machine
The "52 Friends" source code is now forked to your Github profile. To get the source code to your local machine, it varies by how your have your personal computer set up. Consult Github's documentation for how to set up, and work with, Git on your local machine.

### make changes to the source code, and push those to your Github fork
Again, the specifics vary by how your personal machine is set up--consult Github's documentation.

### create pull request to trunk
At the [trunk](https://github.com/roseaboveit/FiftyTwoFriends), click on "New pull request" (top left corner).

### continue the cycle as you, and everyone else, progresses
(to be written by @boomzilla )
